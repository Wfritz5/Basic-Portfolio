    <p id="bio" >Hi! My name is William Fritz and I am attending a full stack web development boot camp at Denver University. Prior to this, I have no experience in the industry, but I am learning more and more each day! I am excited to see where this career path takes me within the next year.<br>
        Some of my hobbies that I used to enjoy doing (before dedicating my life to this boot camp) are making music, watching netflix, playing video games, and traveling. I have been producing beats for over a year now, and really enjoy the elaborate process in producing. When I need a break, Netflix is my go to. I have enjoyed watching many series (usually stand-up comedy) with my girlfriend. These series include: "Nailed it!", "Grace and Frankie", and "Blue Planet." 
        <br>I enjoy first person shooter video games like "Call of Duty." Although, I have been dissappointed with how the game has evolved into a more futuristic era. I enjoy traveling places with my girlfriend. Our most recent trip was in the surrounding area of Times Square in New York, where we watched the famous ball drop entering 2019. Although very rainy, it was a great experience and an opportunity to cross something off of our bucket list together! </p>
